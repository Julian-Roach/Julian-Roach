Hello, my name is Julian! (You can also call me "Mr. Roach" ðŸŽ©ðŸª³)

This used to be longer, but after two years, life has changed.

"Today is renewed, is reborn
Each day, I am new, I am yours"

Anyway, I am currently - as of 21st September 2024 - writing a library for C++ that makes solving rational-numbered linear systems of equations incredibly easy. Well, I need this library for personal use, but I think it can be useful in the future as well, and also for other programmers perhappiehappiehaps?
