Hello, my name is Julian! (You can also call me "Mr. Roach" 🎩🪳)

I came to GitHub to learn more about coding, \
and I plan to make a library but also a 2D game. 📚🎮

Currently, I live in Germany, but I'm Polish. 🇵🇱 🇩🇪 \
I am 16 years old and I love mathematics.

If you want to help me creating our own little roach-verse, \
here's my E-mail: julianroach.dev.business@gmail.com 💸💸💸

Have a nice day! ❤️
